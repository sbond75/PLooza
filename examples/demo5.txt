// error: l foo = x in y;

// Multi-layer whereclause usage:

// A whereclause limits who can box up a function for usage later basically. If I use a whereclause in one function body, then no one can call that function..

l foo = x in print x;

l example1 = x in foo x where print is io.print;

example1 x; // Error: whereclause was used in the body.
// Can't do: example1 x where print is io.print;
