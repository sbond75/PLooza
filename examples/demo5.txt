// error: l foo = x in y;

// Only top-level code can use whereclauses for replacing IO effects.
// For example, this lambda can only have its `print` replaced by io.print (since it is in the `io` map part of the standard library) in a top-level (topmost) declaration (like `example2`).
l foo = x in print x;

// This is an error because the `where` applies to a function call `foo x` which is *not* top-level:
// l example1 = x in foo x where print is io.print;

// This is ok since it is top-level
foo "hi" where print is io.print;

// And if I do this...
l example2 = x in foo x;
// ...followed by:
example2 "hi" where print is io.print;
// Then this will work.
