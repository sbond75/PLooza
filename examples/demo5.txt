// error: l foo = x in y;

// Multi-layer whereclause usage:

// A whereclause limits who can box up a function for usage later basically. If I use a whereclause in one function body, then no one can call that function..

l foo = x in print x;

l example1 = x in foo x where print is io.print;

//example1 "hi"; // Error: whereclause was used in the body.
// Also can't do: example1 "hi" where print is io.print;

// But if I do:

l example2 = x in foo x;

// And then:

example2 "hi" where print is io.print;

// Then this will work.
