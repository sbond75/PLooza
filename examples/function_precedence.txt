l add = x in (y in x);
//io.print add 1 2; // since io.print only takes one argument, this calls `io.print add` and then tries to apply the result to 1, 2 but this fails since it is calling Type.Void as a function          (old idea: prints each of these individually: add, 1, 2)
io.print (add 1 2); // prints 1

l add = x,y in x + y;
io.print (add 1 2); // prints 3
